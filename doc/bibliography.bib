  abstract     = {Metagenomics has transformed our understanding of
    the microbial world, allowing researchers to bypass the need to
    isolate and culture individual taxa and to directly characterize
    both the taxonomic and gene compositions of environmental samples.
    However, associating the genes found in a metagenomic sample with
    the specific taxa of origin remains a critical challenge. Existing
    binning methods, based on nucleotide composition or alignment to
    reference genomes allow only a coarse-grained classification and
    rely heavily on the availability of sequenced genomes from closely
    related taxa. Here, we introduce a novel computational framework,
    integrating variation in gene abundances across multiple samples
    with taxonomic abundance data to deconvolve metagenomic samples
    into taxa-specific gene profiles and to reconstruct the genomic
    content of community members. This assembly-free method is not
    bounded by various factors limiting previously described methods
    of metagenomic binning or metagenomic assembly and represents a
    fundamentally different approach to metagenomic-based genome
    reconstruction. An implementation of this framework is available
    at http://elbo.gs.washington.edu/software.html. We first describe
    the mathematical foundations of our framework and discuss
    considerations for implementing its various components. We
    demonstrate the ability of this framework to accurately deconvolve
    a set of metagenomic samples and to recover the gene content of
    individual taxa using synthetic metagenomic samples. We
    specifically characterize determinants of prediction accuracy and
    examine the impact of annotation errors on the reconstructed
    genomes. We finally apply metagenomic deconvolution to samples
    from the Human Microbiome Project, successfully reconstructing
    genus-level genomic content of various microbial genera, based
    solely on variation in gene count. These reconstructed genera are
    shown to correctly capture genus-specific properties. With the
    accumulation of metagenomic data, this deconvolution framework
    provides an essential tool for characterizing microbial taxa never
    before seen, laying the foundation for addressing fundamental
    questions concerning the taxa comprising diverse microbial
    communities.},

    the more informative it is. Historically, bacterial and archaeal
    genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures, and
    the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion.
    However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates
    precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial
    life. Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to
    initially as community genomics and subsequently as
    genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by
    obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); but gaps, local
    assembly errors, chimeras, and contamination by fragments from
    other genomes limit the value of these genomes. Here, we discuss
    genome curation to improve and, in some cases, achieve complete
    (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs). To date, few CMAGs have been
    generated, although notably some are from very complex systems
    such as soil and sediment. Through analysis of about 7000
    published complete bacterial isolate genomes, we verify the value
    of cumulative GC skew in combination with other metrics to
    establish bacterial genome sequence accuracy. The analysis of
    cumulative GC skew identified potential misassemblies in some
    reference genomes of isolated bacteria and the repeat sequences
    that likely gave rise to them. We discuss methods that could be

    facilitate the assessment of the performance of CDS prediction
    tools. This makes it possible to identify which performs better
    for specific use-cases. We use this to assess 15 ab initio- and
    model-based tools representing those most widely used
    (historically and currently) to generate the knowledge in genomic
    databases. We find that the performance of any tool is dependent
    on the genome being analysed, and no individual tool ranked as the
    most accurate across all genomes or metrics analysed. Even the
    top-ranked tools produced conflicting gene collections, which
    could not be resolved by aggregation. The ORForise evaluation
    framework provides users with a replicable, data-led approach to
    make informed tool choices for novel genome annotations and for
    refining historical annotations.Code and datasets for reproduction

    remains a difficult problem. Current sequencing technologies do

    number of short sequences whose exact origin is unknown. Since
    these sequences are usually smaller than the average length of a

    data.Results: We present MetaProdigal, a metagenomic version of
    the gene prediction program Prodigal, that can identify genes in
    short, anonymous coding sequences with a high degree of accuracy.
    The novel value of the method consists of enhanced translation
    initiation site identification, ability to identify sequences that
    use alternate genetic codes and confidence values for each gene
    call. We compare the results of MetaProdigal with other methods

  abstract     = {Genomic differences between gut-resident bacterial
    strains likely underlie significant interindividual variation in
    microbiome function. Traditional methods of determining community
    composition, such as 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, fail to
    capture this functional diversity. Metagenomic approaches are a
    significant step forward in identifying strain-level sequence
    variants; however, given the current paucity of biochemical
    information, they too are limited to mainly low-resolution and
    incomplete functional predictions. Using genomic, biochemical, and
    molecular approaches, we identified differences in the fructan
    utilization profiles of two closely related Bacteroides
    thetaiotaomicron strains. B.~thetaiotaomicron 8736 (Bt-8736)
    contains a fructan polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) with a
    divergent susC/susD homolog gene pair that enables it to utilize
    inulin, differentiating this strain from other characterized Bt
    strains. Transfer of the distinct pair of susC/susD genes from
    Bt-8736 into the noninulin using type strain B.~thetaiotaomicron
    VPI-5482 resulted in inulin use by the recipient strain,
    Bt(8736-2). The presence of the divergent susC/susD gene pair
    alone enabled the hybrid Bt(8736-2) strain to outcompete the
    wild-type strain in vivo in mice fed an inulin diet. Further, we
    discovered that the susC/susD homolog gene pair facilitated import
    of inulin into the periplasm without surface predigestion by an
    endo-acting enzyme, possibly due to the short average chain length
    of inulin compared to many other polysaccharides. Our data builds
    upon recent reports of dietary polysaccharide utilization
    mechanisms found in members of the Bacteroides genus and
    demonstrates how the acquisition of two genes can alter the
    functionality and success of a strain within the gut. IMPORTANCE
    Dietary polysaccharides play a dominant role in shaping the
    composition and functionality of our gut microbiota. Dietary
    interventions using these microbiota-accessible carbohydrates
    (MACs) serve as a promising tool for manipulating the gut
    microbial community. However, our current gap in knowledge
    regarding microbial metabolic pathways that are involved in the
    degradation of these MACs has made the design of rational
    interventions difficult. The issue is further complicated by the
    diversity of pathways observed for the utilization of similar
    MACs, even in closely related microbial strains. Our current work
    focuses on divergent fructan utilization pathways in two closely
    related B.~thetaiotaomicron strains and provides an integrated
    approach to characterize the molecular basis for strain-level
    functional differences.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in
    clinically relevant bacteria is a growing threat to public health
    globally. In these bacteria, antimicrobial resistance genes are
    often associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which
    promote their mobility, enabling them to rapidly spread throughout
    a bacterial community. METHODS: The tool MobileElementFinder was
    developed to enable rapid detection of MGEs and their genetic
    context in assembled sequence data. MGEs are detected based on
    sequence similarity to a database of 4452 known elements augmented
    with annotation of resistance genes, virulence factors and
    detection of plasmids. RESULTS: MobileElementFinder was applied to
    analyse the mobilome of 1725 sequenced Salmonella enterica
    isolates of animal origin from Denmark, Germany and the USA. We
    found that the MGEs were seemingly conserved according to
    multilocus ST and not restricted to either the host or the country
    of origin. Moreover, we identified putative translocatable units
    for specific aminoglycoside, sulphonamide and tetracycline genes.
    Several putative composite transposons were predicted that could
    mobilize, among others, AMR, metal resistance and
    phosphodiesterase genes associated with macrophage survivability.
    This is, to our knowledge, the first time the
    phosphodiesterase-like pdeL has been found to be potentially
    mobilized into S. enterica. CONCLUSIONS: MobileElementFinder is a
    powerful tool to study the epidemiology of MGEs in a large number
    of genome sequences and to determine the potential for genomic
    plasticity of bacteria. This web service provides a convenient
    method of detecting MGEs in assembled sequence data.

    Strain identification revealed subspecies clades specific to body
    sites; it also quantified species with phylogenetic diversity
    under-represented in isolate genomes. Body-wide functional
    profiling classified pathways into universal, human-enriched, and
    body site-enriched subsets. Finally, temporal analysis decomposed
    microbial variation into rapidly variable, moderately variable,
    and stable subsets. This study furthers our knowledge of baseline

  abstract     = {Bacterial pathogens utilize a myriad of mechanisms
    to invade mammalian hosts, damage tissue sites, and evade the
    immune system. One essential strategy of Gram-negative bacteria is
    the secretion of virulence factors through both inner and outer
    membranes to reach a potential target. Most secretion systems are
    harbored in mobile elements including transposons, plasmids,
    pathogenicity islands, and phages, and Escherichia coli is one of
    the more versatile bacteria adopting this genetic information by
    horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, E. coli is a bacterial
    species with members of the commensal intestinal microbiota and
    pathogens associated with numerous types of infections such as
    intestinal, urinary, and systemic in humans and other animals.
    T6SS cluster plasticity suggests evolutionarily divergent systems
    were acquired horizontally. T6SS is a secretion nanomachine that
    is extended through the bacterial double membrane; from this
    apparatus, substrates are conveyed straight from the cytoplasm of
    the bacterium into a target cell or to the extracellular space.
    This nanomachine consists of three main complexes: proteins in the
    inner membrane that are T4SS component-like, the baseplate
    complex, and the tail complex, which are formed by components
    evolutionarily related to contractile bacteriophage tails.
    Advances in the T6SS understanding include the functional and
    structural characterization of at least 13 subunits (so-called
    core components), which are thought to comprise the minimal
    apparatus. So far, the main role of T6SS is on bacterial
    competition by using it to kill neighboring non-immune bacteria
    for which antibacterial proteins are secreted directly into the
    periplasm of the bacterial target after cell--cell contact.
    Interestingly, a few T6SSs have been associated directly to
    pathogenesis, e.g., roles in biofilm formation and macrophage
    survival. Here, we focus on the advances on T6SS from the
    perspective of E. coli pathotypes with emphasis in the secretion
    apparatus architecture, the mechanisms of pathogenicity of
    effector proteins, and the events of lateral gene transfer that
    led to its spread.},

    Our method leverages a database of more than 30,000 bacterial

    cover the majority of abundant species in the human microbiome but
    only a small proportion of microbes in other environments,
    including soil and seawater. We applied MIDAS to stool metagenomes
    from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants over one year and used
    rare SNPs to track strains between hosts. Using this approach, we
    found that although species compositions of mothers and infants
    converged over time, strain-level similarity diverged.
    Specifically, early colonizing bacteria were often transmitted
    from an infant's mother, while late colonizing bacteria were often
    transmitted from other sources in the environment and were
    enriched for spore-formation genes. We also applied MIDAS to 198
    globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene content to
    show that many prevalent bacterial species have population

    achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial
    communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation.
    Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes
    that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many
    species are still not sequenced or have only few strains
    available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo
    assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and
    reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current
    methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many
    accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain
    unassociated to core clusters.We introduce MSPminer, a
    computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes
    Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant
    genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust
    measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to
    group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory
    genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer
    successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of
    1661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher
    sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs
    reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in
    the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The
    provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and
    biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In
    addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other

    greatly in this present century of pathogen dominance. Inspite of
    extensive research efforts and scientific advancements, the
    worldwide emergence of microbial tolerance continues to plague
    survivability. The innate property of microbe to resist any
    antibiotic due to evolution is the virtue of intrinsic resistance.
    However, the classical genetic mutations and extrachromosomal
    segments causing gene exchange attribute to acquired tolerance
    development. Rampant use of antimicrobials causes certain
    selection pressure which increases the resistance frequency.
    Genomic duplication, enzymatic site modification, target
    alteration, modulation in membrane permeability, and the efflux
    pump mechanism are the major contributors of multidrug resistance
    (MDR), specifically antibiotic tolerance development. MDRs will
    lead to clinical failures for treatment and pose health crisis.
    The molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are diverse
    as well as complex and still are exploited for new discoveries in
    order to prevent the surfacing of ``superbugs.'' Antimicrobial
    chemotherapy has diminished the threat of infectious diseases to
    some extent. To avoid the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the
    new ones licensed for use have decreased with time. Additionally,
    in vitro assays and genomics for anti-infectives are novel
    approaches used in resolving the issues of microbial resistance.
    Proper use of drugs can keep it under check and minimize the risk

    tool () for which the source code is not publicly available,
    algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a

    fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target
    sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a
    similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then
    performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against
    potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead
    of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise
    alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and
    multiple threads. Results VSEARCH includes most commands for
    analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and
    several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including
    searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by
    similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a
    user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de
    novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment,
    reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also
    includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format
    detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of
    paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with
    several new commands and improvements, including shuffling,
    rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the
    well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity
    definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here
    shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching,
    clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with
    USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than
    USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but

    deconvolution of allele frequencies from shotgun metagenomic data

    orders of magnitude. A GPU implementation provides additional

    perform strain inference on thousands of metagenomes and has
    comparable accuracy to more computationally intensive tools. We
    further validate our strain inferences using single-cell genomic
    sequencing from a human stool sample. Applying StrainFacts to a
    collection of more than 10,000 publicly available human stool
    metagenomes, we quantify patterns of strain diversity,

    analysis pipelines; it reduces the volume of data by identifying
    the most likely reading frame for a fragment, permitting the
    out-of-frame translations to be ignored. In this study we evaluate
    five widely used ab initio gene-calling algorithms---FragGeneScan,
    MetaGeneAnnotator, MetaGeneMark, Orphelia, and Prodigal---for
    accuracy on short (75--1000\,bp) fragments containing sequence
    error from previously published artificial data and ``real''

    similar accuracies predicting genes on error-free fragments, in
    the presence of sequencing errors considerable differences between
    tools become evident. For error-containing short reads,
    FragGeneScan finds more prokaryotic coding regions than does
    MetaGeneAnnotator, MetaGeneMark, Orphelia, or Prodigal. This
    improved detection of genes in error-containing fragments,
    however, comes at the cost of much lower (50\%) specificity and

    computational burden of annotating individual nucleic acid reads
    and are used in many metagenomic annotation systems. For

    several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging
    methods showing promise to further improve metagenotyping in
    response to the rapid growth in genome collections. Our results
    have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in
    microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.},

  abstract     = {Advances in sequencing technology have led to the
    increased availability of genomes and metagenomes, which has
    greatly facilitated microbial pan-genome and metagenome analysis
    in the community. In line with this trend, studies on microbial
    genomes and phenotypes have gradually shifted from individuals to
    environmental communities. Pan-genomics and metagenomics are
    powerful strategies for in-depth profiling study of microbial
    communities. Pan-genomics focuses on genetic diversity, dynamics,
    and phylogeny at the multi-genome level, while metagenomics
    profiles the distribution and function of culture-free microbial
    communities in special environments. Combining pan-genome and
    metagenome analysis can reveal the microbial complicated
    connections from an individual complete genome to a mixture of
    genomes, thereby extending the catalog of traditional individual
    genomic profile to community microbial profile. Therefore, the
    combination of pan-genome and metagenome approaches has become a
    promising method to track the sources of various microbes and
    decipher the population-level evolution and ecosystem functions.
    This review summarized the pan-genome and metagenome approaches,
    the combined strategies of pan-genome and metagenome, and
    applications of these combined strategies in studies of microbial
    dynamics, evolution, and function in communities. We discussed
    emerging strategies for the study of microbial communities that
    integrate information in both pan-genome and metagenome. We
    emphasized studies in which the integrating pan-genome with
    metagenome approach improved the understanding of models of
    microbial community profiles, both structural and functional.
    Finally, we illustrated future perspectives of microbial community
    profile: more advanced analytical techniques, including big-data
    based artificial intelligence, will lead to an even better
    understanding of the patterns of microbial communities.},
